 ☐ move more heavy lifting into workers
 ☐ arbitrary JS eval component
 ☐ labels/groups might be nice
 ☐ saving a group of components as a new component would be super fancy
 ☐ custom defined file types
 ☐ sort components
 ☐ BUG: connections dont show up right if design panel isnt visible when they're created..moving each object fixes, maybe just need repaint when showing tab
